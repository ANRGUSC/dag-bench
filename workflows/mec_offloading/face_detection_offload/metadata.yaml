  notes: "Paper studies binary offloading decisions (each user has a single indivisible
    task) using game theory. It does not contain any DAG or task dependency graph.
    This face detection pipeline is an AI-generated task graph inspired by MEC offloading
    concepts, not extracted from the paper."
