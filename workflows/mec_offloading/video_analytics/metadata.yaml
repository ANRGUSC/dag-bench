  notes: "Paper describes video analytics as operations organized as a DAG (decoder,
    object detector, tracker, classifier). Figure 2 shows the video analytics stack
    architecture. However, it does not provide a specific extractable task graph with
    costs and edge weights. The original DOI (10.1109/MC.2017.185) was incorrect
    (resolved to an unrelated page); corrected to verified DOI. This video analytics
    pipeline is an AI interpretation of the DAG concept described in the paper."
