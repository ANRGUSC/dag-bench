  notes: "Paper is a broad IoT survey in IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics
    reviewing RFID, WSN, and industrial IoT applications. It does not contain any
    DAG, task dependency graph, or chemical process control pipeline figure. This
    process control pipeline is an AI-generated task graph inspired by industrial
    IoT concepts described in the survey."
