  notes: "The original DOI (10.1109/TII.2019.2938890) resolved to a completely
    different paper (Yuan et al. on soft sensor deep learning). Corrected to the
    real Wan et al. paper about reconfigurable smart factories. The paper describes
    drug packing in Industry 4.0, not robotic assembly per se, and does not contain
    an extractable task dependency DAG. This robotic assembly pipeline is an
    AI-generated task graph inspired by smart factory concepts."
