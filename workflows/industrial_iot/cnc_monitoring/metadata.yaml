  notes: "Paper is a 23-page review/survey of sensor-based monitoring of machining
    processes in CIRP Annals. It covers sensor technologies, signal processing, and
    decision-making strategies but does not contain any DAG or task dependency graph
    figure. This CNC monitoring pipeline is an AI-generated task graph inspired by
    the machining monitoring concepts described in the paper."
