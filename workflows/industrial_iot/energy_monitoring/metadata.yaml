  notes: Paper reviews industrial power and energy metering in manufacturing facilities,
    covering metering infrastructure, data collection, and energy analytics. It does
    not contain any DAG or task dependency graph. This factory energy monitoring
    pipeline is an AI-generated task graph inspired by the metering architecture
    described in the paper.
