  notes: "Paper is a review of digital twin technology in IEEE Transactions on Industrial
    Informatics. It does not contain any DAG or task dependency graph. The original
    DOI (10.1007/s12206-019-0823-4) was fabricated (404, pointed to Journal of
    Mechanical Science and Technology); corrected to the real IEEE TII DOI. This
    digital twin pipeline is an AI-generated task graph inspired by the digital twin
    concepts described in the paper."
