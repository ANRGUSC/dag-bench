  notes: "Paper trains deep CNNs (AlexNet, GoogLeNet) on 54,306 images of
    diseased/healthy plant leaves in Frontiers in Plant Science. It contains accuracy
    comparison figures and tables but no DAG, task dependency graph, or processing
    pipeline diagram. This crop disease detection pipeline is an AI-generated task
    graph inspired by the image classification concepts described in the paper."
