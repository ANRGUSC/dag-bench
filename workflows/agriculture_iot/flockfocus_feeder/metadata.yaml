description: Video analytics pipeline for automated poultry feeding behavior monitoring,
  faithfully extracted from Figure 1 of Ghafouri et al. (arXiv 2025). The feeder pipeline
  detects chickens (UNeXt) and feeders (YOLOX) in parallel, tracks chickens over time
  via multi-object tracking, analyzes feeding behavior based on spatial proximity
  to feeders, and estimates bird weights from bounding box dimensions. Deployed on
  AWS g4dn.2xlarge instances with NVIDIA T4 GPU.

  notes: 'DAG structure faithfully extracted from the Feeder pipeline row of Figure
    1 (''FlockFocus system architecture and per-zone video pipelines''). The feeder
    pipeline monitors chicken feeding behavior at commercial poultry farms. Tasks
    are the processing modules with sharp-cornered boxes in the figure: ChickenDetector
    (UNeXt segmentation), FeederDetector (YOLOX detection), TrackingAlg (two-stage
    tracking-by-detection), FeedingAnalysis (feeding behavior classification based
    on proximity to feeder lines), WeightAnalysis (regression model for weight estimation
    from bounding box dimensions). Task costs are proportional to processing times
    reported in the paper: detection ~2000s, tracking ~5000s, behavior analysis ~22000s
    per 5-minute video on AWS g4dn.2xlarge (NVIDIA T4, 16GB VRAM, 8 vCPUs). Data transfer
    sizes are estimated from intermediate result dimensions. Affiliations: Queen''s
