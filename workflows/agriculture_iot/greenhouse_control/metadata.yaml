  notes: Paper is a comprehensive review of greenhouse automation covering sensor
    monitoring (temperature, humidity, light, CO2, soil moisture), climate control
    models, and actuator systems (HVAC, irrigation, lighting, CO2 enrichment). It does
    not contain any DAG or task dependency graph. This greenhouse control pipeline is
    an AI-generated task graph inspired by the sensor-to-actuator architecture described
    in the paper.
