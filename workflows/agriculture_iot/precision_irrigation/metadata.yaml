  notes: "Paper is a survey of wireless sensor networks for agriculture in Computers
    and Electronics in Agriculture. It reviews system architectures, communication
    protocols, and deployment challenges but does not contain any DAG or task
    dependency graph. This precision irrigation pipeline is an AI-generated task
    graph inspired by agricultural WSN concepts described in the survey."
