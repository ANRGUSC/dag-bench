  notes: Paper reviews wearable sensor technologies for livestock health monitoring
    including temperature, movement, and location sensing. It does not contain any
    DAG or task dependency graph. This livestock monitoring pipeline is an AI-generated
    task graph inspired by the sensor-to-analytics architecture described in the paper.
