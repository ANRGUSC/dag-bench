  notes: Based on 3GPP TS 23.501 which defines the 5G Service-Based Architecture
    including the UE attach procedure via AMF, AUSF, UDM, NRF, NSSF, SMF, and UPF
    network functions. The standard does not contain a task dependency DAG, but the
    attach procedure's sequential and parallel NF interactions map naturally to a DAG
    structure. This workflow is an AI-generated task graph inspired by the 5G attach
    signaling flow.
