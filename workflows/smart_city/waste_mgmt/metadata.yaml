  notes: Paper surveys IoT-based solid waste management covering smart bin sensors,
    fill-level monitoring, collection route optimization, and truck scheduling. It
    does not contain any DAG or task dependency graph. This waste management pipeline
    is an AI-generated task graph inspired by the IoT waste collection architecture
    described in the paper.
