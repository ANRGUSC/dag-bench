  notes: "Paper is a survey/tutorial in IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials
    about traffic management systems for smart cities. The original DOI
    (10.1109/JIOT.2014.2375731) was fabricated (404, wrong journal code JIOT instead
    of COMST); corrected to the real DOI. The paper does not contain any DAG or
    task dependency graph. This traffic management pipeline is an AI-generated task
    graph inspired by smart city traffic concepts described in the survey."
