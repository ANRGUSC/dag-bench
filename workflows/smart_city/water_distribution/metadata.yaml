  notes: Paper presents a practical approach to flow monitoring and anomaly detection
    in water distribution networks using SCADA sensors. It does not contain any DAG
    or task dependency graph. This water distribution pipeline is an AI-generated task
    graph inspired by the sensor monitoring and leak detection architecture described
    in the paper.
