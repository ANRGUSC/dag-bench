description: "Distributed ML inference pipeline for edge-based video monitoring,
  faithfully extracted from Figure 1 of Wu et al. (MILCOM 2024). Multi-modal sensors
  (camera, microphone, seismic) feed two parallel detection-classification branches:
  vehicle detection (YOLOv4) followed by vehicle classification (EfficientNet/ResNet),
  and human detection followed by person identification. Deployed across heterogeneous
  edge servers (Nvidia A2, Orin Nano, GTX 1080)."

  notes: "DAG structure faithfully extracted from Figure 1 ('Distributed ML Inference
    Pipelines at the edge'). The paper describes a video monitoring pipeline using
    object detection models (YOLOv4) to identify vehicles and people, with downstream
    classification (EfficientNetB0/B5, ResNet50). The pipeline was profiled on Nvidia
    A2, Orin Nano, and GTX 1080 GPUs. Task costs are normalized estimates based on
    the paper's description of model computational requirements (YOLOv4 detection is
    heaviest, classification is moderate, encoding is lightweight). Data transfer sizes
    are estimated from typical image/feature dimensions. The paper shows end-to-end
    response times in Figures 4-5 but does not provide per-task cost tables. The
    multi-modal sensing structure (camera + audio for human detection, camera + seismic
    for vehicle detection) reflects Section III.A and V of the paper. Network node
    speeds reflect the three GPU types profiled. Affiliations: UMass Amherst, UC Santa
    Cruz, UIUC, Army Research Lab."
