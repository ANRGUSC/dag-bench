description: "Distributed video query pipeline for edge-based traffic analytics,
  faithfully extracted from Figure 1 of Liang et al. (JNCA 2024). An object detector
  (YOLOv5m) classifies detected objects as person or vehicle, routing to two cascaded
  classification branches: person branch (gender classifier, then behaviour classifier)
  and vehicle branch (type classifier, then maker classifier), with results collected
  at a final aggregation node. Deployed across heterogeneous edge devices (Jetson
  Nano, AGX Xavier, Intel E5 server)."

  notes: "DAG structure faithfully extracted from Figure 1 ('A representative video
    query pipeline'). The pipeline detects objects via YOLOv5m then routes to person
    or vehicle classification branches, each with two cascaded ResNet classifiers.
    Task costs are actual inference times (ms) on Jetson Nano 4GB from Table 1:
    ObjectDetection=574ms (YOLOv5m), GenderClassifier=23.1ms (ResNet18),
    BehaviourClassifier=23.1ms (ResNet18), TypeClassifier=45ms (ResNet34),
    MakerClassifier=45ms (ResNet34). ResultCollector cost (5ms) is estimated.
    Network node speeds are derived from YOLOv5m speedup ratios across devices
    in Table 1. Data transfer sizes are estimated from typical intermediate feature
    map and ROI dimensions. Affiliations: Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing
    University, Temple University."
