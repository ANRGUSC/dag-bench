  notes: "Paper is a comprehensive survey of NFV and SFC frameworks published in
    Future Internet (MDPI). It contains taxonomy diagrams and architectural overviews
    but no DAG or task dependency graph figures. This SFC pipeline is an AI-generated
    task graph inspired by the NFV/SFC concepts described in the survey."
