description: "Distributed matrix operations pipeline faithfully extracted from Figure 5
  (Application 4) of Li et al. (arXiv 2024). A matrix is loaded then forked to
  transpose and multiply operations. Both feed into a matrix-vector multiplication,
  while the multiply result also feeds into matrix inversion. The inversion and first
  mat-vec multiply converge at a final mat-vec multiply, creating complex overlapping
  diamond structures. The most structurally interesting of the four M-TEC applications."

  notes: "DAG structure faithfully extracted from Figure 5 'DAG-based applications
    used in the experiments', specifically Application 4 (Matrix Operations). The
    pipeline loads a matrix, then performs transpose and multiply in parallel. Both
    results feed into a matrix-vector multiplication, while the multiply also feeds
    into inversion. The final mat-vec multiply combines inversion and first mat-vec
    results. This creates overlapping diamond structures making it the most
    topologically interesting M-TEC app. Task costs are estimated proportional to
    computational complexity: O(n^3) operations (multiply, inversion) are heaviest,
    O(n^2) operations (transpose, mat-vec) moderate, I/O lightest. Data transfer
    sizes estimated from typical matrix dimensions. Evaluated on heterogeneous
    testbed (Table III). Affiliations: Purdue University."
