  notes: "Paper presents a dependent task offloading model with face recognition as
    a case study. It contains DAG figures showing task decomposition for face
    recognition, but this workflow's 7-task structure with specific task names was
    AI-generated and does not faithfully reproduce any figure from the paper. The
    paper was published in Electronics (MDPI) in 2025, not 2023 as originally
    claimed."
