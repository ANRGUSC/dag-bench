description: Edge-based face analysis pipeline with pipeline-parallel multi-task learning,
  faithfully extracted from Figures 4-5 of a Computers (MDPI) 2025 paper. YOLOv8 detects
  and crops heads, VGG-Face extracts features, then three parallel MTL classification
  modules (hair, gender, face ID) run on distributed Raspberry Pi edge devices, with
  results aggregated at a write-back stage. Each MTL module produces two classification
  outputs (e.g., hair color + hairstyle, gender + smile, face recognition + age estimation).

  notes: "DAG structure faithfully extracted from Figure 4 (pipeline stages) and Figure\
    \ 5 (pipeline-parallel architecture). Stage 1: YOLOv8 head detection on edge server.\
    \ Stage 2: VGG-Face feature extraction on edge server. Stage 3: three parallel\
    \ MTL classification modules distributed across Raspberry Pi 4 devices \u2014\
    \ HairModule (hair color + hairstyle), GenderModule (gender + smile), FaceIDModule\
    \ (face recognition + age estimation). Stage 4: write-back aggregation. The paper\
    \ reports 8.2s total per individual but does not provide per-stage breakdown.\
    \ Task costs are proportional estimates based on model complexity (YOLOv8 and\
    \ VGG-Face are heaviest, MTL modules are lighter, write-back is minimal). Data\
    \ transfer sizes are estimated from typical feature vector dimensions. Network\
    \ reflects the paper's architecture: Core i5 edge server + 3 RPi 4 devices."
