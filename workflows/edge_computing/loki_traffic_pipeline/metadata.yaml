description: 'Multi-model traffic analysis pipeline faithfully extracted from Figure
  2(a) of Ahmad et al. (HPDC 2024). A YOLOv5 object detector feeds two parallel downstream
  classifiers: car classification (EfficientNet) for vehicle type identification and
  facial recognition (VGG) for person identification. Part of the Loki system for
  latency-aware ML inference serving on GPU clusters with 250ms SLO targets.'

  notes: DAG structure faithfully extracted from Figure 2(a) showing the traffic analysis
    pipeline. ObjectDetection uses YOLOv5, CarClassification uses EfficientNet, and
    FacialRecognition uses VGG. The paper evaluates 32 model variants across two pipelines
    (traffic and social media) on GTX 1080 Ti GPUs. The traffic pipeline has a 250ms
    SLO. Task costs are estimated proportional to typical inference times for these
    model architectures (YOLOv5 heaviest, VGG moderate, EfficientNet lightest). Data
    transfer sizes are estimated from typical ROI dimensions. The pipeline is compact
    (3 tasks) but represents a real production video analytics pattern. Network models
    a homogeneous GPU cluster.
