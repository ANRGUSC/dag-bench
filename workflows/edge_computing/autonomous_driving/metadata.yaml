  notes: "Paper presents a dependency-aware task offloading framework for vehicular
    edge computing. Figure 1(a) shows a small generic 5-node example DAG illustrating
    task dependencies, but this workflow's 11-task structure with domain-specific names
    (LiDAR, Camera, SensorFusion, etc.) does not correspond to any figure in the
    paper. This autonomous driving pipeline is an AI-generated task graph inspired
    by vehicular edge computing concepts."
