description: "Distributed video analytics pipeline faithfully extracted from Figure 5
  (Application 3) of Li et al. (arXiv 2024). Video data is read from storage, split
  into segments, then processed through two parallel branches of frame extraction and
  classification before results are written back to storage. A metadata/manifest edge
  from SplitVideo to WriteStorage completes the 8-edge structure. Evaluated on a real
  heterogeneous testbed with Desktop, Jetson AGX Xavier, Xavier NX, and TX2 devices."

  notes: "DAG structure faithfully extracted from Figure 5 'DAG-based applications
    used in the experiments', specifically Application 3 (Video Analytics). The
    pipeline reads video from storage, splits into segments, extracts frames through
    two parallel branches, classifies each branch, and writes results. The bypass
    edge from SplitVideo to WriteStorage carries segment metadata. Task costs are
    estimated proportional to computational complexity (classification is heaviest,
    I/O is lightest). Data transfer sizes are estimated from typical video processing
    data dimensions. The paper evaluates on a real testbed with heterogeneous hardware
    (Table III): Desktop (16-core x86, 32GB), Jetson AGX Xavier (8-core ARM, 16GB),
    Xavier NX (6-core ARM, 8GB), Jetson TX2 (4-core ARM, 8GB). Network speeds
    reflect wired LAN connections. Affiliations: Purdue University."
