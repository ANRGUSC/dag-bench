description: "Mobile navigation application DAG from the SLEIPNIR offloading simulator
  (De Maio and Brandic, CCGrid 2018). A config panel and GPS sensor feed into a control
  node that fans out to map loading, path calculation, and traffic monitoring. Map
  data and traffic flow into path calculation, which then fans out to voice synthesis,
  speed trap alerts, and GUI display. The richest DAG structure among the five SLEIPNIR
  apps, with 9 tasks and complex fan-out/fan-in patterns."

  notes: "DAG structure and task computation costs (in MI - millions of instructions)
    faithfully extracted from the SLEIPNIR open-source Java simulator, specifically
    NavigatorApp.java. Tasks include configuration, GPS, map loading, path calculation,
    traffic monitoring, voice synthesis, speed trap alerts, and GUI display. Several
    tasks are marked non-offloadable in the source (CONF_PANEL, GPS, VOICE_SYNTH,
    SPEED_TRAP, GUI). Data transfer sizes are normalized from SLEIPNIR source code
    data volumes (outData parameters) to produce balanced CCR ratios suitable for
    scheduling benchmarks. The original outData values include stochastic map data
    sizes (exponential distribution with mean 25MB); we use representative fixed
    values. Network is a 3-node MEC topology with 1 mobile device and 2 edge servers.
