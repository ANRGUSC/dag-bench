description: "Mobile social media application DAG from the SLEIPNIR offloading simulator
  (De Maio and Brandic, CCGrid 2018). The GUI fans out to authentication (GET_TOKEN)
  and API request in parallel, then proceeds through response processing, file upload,
  image filter application, and final post creation. Near-linear chain with an early
  fork-join at GUI, 7 tasks total."

  notes: "DAG structure and task computation costs (in MI) faithfully extracted from
    FacebookApp.java in the SLEIPNIR simulator. GUI, FILE_UPLOAD, and FACEBOOK_POST
    are non-offloadable. Data transfer sizes are normalized from source code data
    volumes: image upload/filter edges (facebookImageSize=20KB) mapped to 1000 data
    units, API control edges mapped to 50 data units, response data to 200 data
    units, producing a balanced CCR of 1.0. Network is a 3-node MEC topology. MIT
