description: "Mobile face recognition application DAG from the SLEIPNIR offloading
  simulator (De Maio and Brandic, CCGrid 2018). The UI triggers face matching, which
  initializes a match database and detects faces in an image, with a bypass edge from
  matching to detection. Chain-with-bypass pattern with 5 tasks, where the heaviest
  task (DETECT_FACE at 1600 MI) performs the core face detection computation."

  notes: "DAG structure and task computation costs (in MI) faithfully extracted from
    FacerecognizerApp.java in the SLEIPNIR simulator. The UI and output tasks are
    non-offloadable. Data transfer sizes are normalized from source code data volumes:
    face image data (facerecImageSize=10MB) mapped to 3000 data units, control signals
    mapped to 100 data units, producing a CCR of 2.04. The original uses fixed image
    sizes (not stochastic). Network is a 3-node MEC topology. MIT licensed source
    code. Affiliations: TU Wien."
