  notes: Paper describes Montage as a grid-enabled astronomical image mosaic engine
    with processing stages (reprojection, background modeling, co-addition) that
    exploit parallelism. The Montage workflow is well-known in the Pegasus workflow
    management ecosystem. This task graph is an AI-generated approximation of the
    Montage processing stages, not extracted from any specific figure in the paper.
