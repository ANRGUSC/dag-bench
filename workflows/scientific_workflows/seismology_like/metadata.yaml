  notes: Paper describes the CyberShake methodology for physics-based seismic hazard
    analysis, including SGT extraction, seismogram synthesis, peak value computation,
    and hazard curve generation. The CyberShake workflow is well-known in the Pegasus
    workflow management ecosystem. This task graph is an AI-generated approximation of
    the CyberShake processing stages, not extracted from any specific figure in the
    paper.
