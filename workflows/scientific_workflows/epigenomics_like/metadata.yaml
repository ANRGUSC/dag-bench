  notes: "The Pegasus paper in Future Generation Computer Systems describes the
    workflow management system and discusses several scientific workflows including
    Epigenomics. The Epigenomics workflow DAG structure is well-documented in the
    Pegasus ecosystem (Workflow Gallery) and widely cited in scheduling literature.
    However, this specific workflow's task names and structure are an AI-generated
    approximation of the Epigenomics pattern, not a faithful extraction from any
    specific figure in the paper or from the Pegasus DAX files."
