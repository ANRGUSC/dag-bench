  notes: "The original BLAST paper in Journal of Molecular Biology describes the
    maximal segment pair scoring algorithm for sequence alignment. It is an algorithm
    paper containing mathematical formulas and statistical tables but no DAG or
    workflow pipeline figure. This BLAST-like workflow is an AI-generated task graph
    modeling a scatter-gather BLAST pipeline pattern (split, parallel search lanes,
    merge, annotate), inspired by how BLAST pipelines work in practice but not
    extracted from any specific figure."
