  notes: "Paper is a hardware/application review of drone systems for agriculture,
    covering drone types, sensors, and spraying mechanisms. It does not contain any
    DAG or task dependency graph. This precision agriculture pipeline is an AI-generated
    task graph inspired by the UAV survey workflows described in the paper."
