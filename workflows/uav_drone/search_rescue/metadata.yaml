  notes: "Paper is a comprehensive survey of UAV networks for civil applications
    from a communications perspective (covering 2000-2015). It discusses routing
    protocols, QoS, and civil applications but does not contain any DAG or task
    dependency graph. The original DOI (10.1109/COMST.2016.2554569) was incorrect
    (404); corrected to verified DOI. The year was also wrong (claimed 2020, actual
    2016). This search-and-rescue pipeline is an AI-generated task graph inspired
    by UAV coordination concepts from the survey."
