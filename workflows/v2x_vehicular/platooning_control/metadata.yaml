  notes: "Original metadata cited 'Campolo et al. 2020' with DOI 10.1109/TVT.2020.2975574,
    but that DOI does not exist (returns 404). Campolo's V2X research focuses on
    radio resource allocation and sidelink protocols, not task scheduling DAGs. This
    platooning control pipeline is an AI-generated task graph inspired by V2X platooning
    concepts."
