  notes: "Paper describes LiDAR-based cooperative perception where connected autonomous
    vehicles share 3D point cloud data to improve detection. It does not contain any
    DAG or task dependency graph. The original DOI (10.1109/TITS.2019.2963966) was
    fabricated (404); corrected to the real DOI at ICDCS 2019. This cooperative perception
    pipeline is an AI-generated task graph inspired by the architecture described in
    the paper."
