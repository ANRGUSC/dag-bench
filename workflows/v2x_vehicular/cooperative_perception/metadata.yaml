  notes: Paper describes LiDAR-based cooperative perception where connected autonomous
    vehicles share 3D point cloud data. It does not contain any DAG or task dependency
    graph. This cooperative perception pipeline is an AI-generated task graph inspired
    by the architecture described in the paper.
