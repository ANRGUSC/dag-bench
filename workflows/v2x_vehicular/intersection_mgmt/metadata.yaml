  notes: "Paper proposes a tile-based reservation protocol for coordinating autonomous
    vehicles through intersections. It does not contain any DAG or task dependency
    graph — it is a multiagent coordination paper, not a task scheduling paper. This
    intersection management pipeline is an AI-generated task graph inspired by the
    concepts described in the paper."
