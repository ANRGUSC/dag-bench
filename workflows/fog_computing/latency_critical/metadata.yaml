  notes: "Paper is a comprehensive 42-page survey of fog computing architectures,
    taxonomy, and related paradigms. It discusses task scheduling in fog but does not
    contain any DAG or task dependency graph figures. The original DOI
    (10.1109/JIOT.2019.2892556) was fabricated (404); the paper was actually published
    in Journal of Systems Architecture, not IEEE IoT Journal. This latency-critical
    pipeline is an AI-generated task graph inspired by fog computing patterns
    described in the survey."
