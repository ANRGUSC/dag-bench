  notes: Paper introduces fog learning as an extension of federated learning across
    heterogeneous fog/edge nodes. It does not contain an extractable task dependency
    DAG. This federated fog pipeline is an AI-generated task graph inspired by the
    multi-layer learning architecture described in the paper.
