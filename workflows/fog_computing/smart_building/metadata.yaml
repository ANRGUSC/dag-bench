  notes: Paper proposes a 5-layer fog-based IoT architecture for smart buildings
    supporting HVAC, lighting, and security systems with environmental sensor monitoring.
    It does not contain any DAG or task dependency graph. This smart building pipeline
    is an AI-generated task graph inspired by the multi-layer fog architecture described
    in the paper.
