  notes: "Paper describes a fog-based smart e-Health gateway architecture for IoT
    healthcare. It does not contain any DAG or task dependency graph. The original
    DOI (10.1016/j.future.2018.04.036) resolved to a completely different paper
    (Kumar et al. on disease prediction using fuzzy neural classifiers); corrected
    to the real Springer chapter DOI. This healthcare fog pipeline is an AI-generated
    task graph inspired by the fog architecture described in the paper."
