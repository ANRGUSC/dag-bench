  notes: "Paper is a seminal fog computing position paper presenting the fog concept,
    use cases (smart traffic lights, connected vehicles), and a hierarchical
    cloud-to-edge architecture. It contains architecture diagrams but no DAG or task
    dependency graph. This three-tier pipeline is an AI-generated task graph inspired
    by the fog computing architecture described in the paper."
