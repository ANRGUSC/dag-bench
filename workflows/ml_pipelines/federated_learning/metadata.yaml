  notes: "Paper in Scientific Reports presents a DAG-based federated learning model
    for IoT networks. It contains DAG figures (Fig. 4) showing the communication
    topology for managing device asynchrony, but these describe the DAG-FL
    communication structure, not a traditional task scheduling DAG with computation
    costs. This federated learning round pipeline is an AI-generated scatter-gather
    task graph modeling one FL round, not directly extracted from any figure in the
    paper."
